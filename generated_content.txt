### Newton's Laws of Motion: A 5-Line Summary

Newton's laws of motion are fundamental principles that describe the behavior of objects in motion. They are:

1. **First Law:** An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.
2. **Second Law:** The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.
3. **Third Law:** For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

These laws form the foundation of classical mechanics and are essential for understanding the motion of everything from planets to cars.
