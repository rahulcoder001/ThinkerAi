### Electric Fields: A Force in Space

An electric field is a region of space where an electric charge would experience a force. This force is invisible, but it's responsible for everything from lightning to the attraction between oppositely charged particles.  

## How Electric Fields Work

* **Charged objects create electric fields.** The strength of the field depends on the amount of charge.
* **Other charged objects feel a force within an electric field.** The direction of the force depends on the sign of the charge (positive charges are repelled, negative charges are attracted).

## Electric Fields: A Fundamental Concept

Electric fields are a fundamental concept in physics, crucial for understanding the behavior of charged objects and the interaction of electric and magnetic forces.
